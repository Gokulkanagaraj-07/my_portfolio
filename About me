my skills in Threat Management, Network Security & Defense, Endpoint Security and 
vulnerability Detection.

experience in cybersecurity beam operations. And in my free time, I have worked on
small-scale simulated attacks and defense Labs conducted vulnerability assessments using 
tools like Nmap Wireshark, Burp suite and also Kali Linux. I gained hands-on experience
with real-time cyberattacks and data breach prevention.

 I am passionate about cybersecurity and related attack prevention, and I have been
involved in phishing Awareness to students in non-technical domains.

 And I'm proud to have various badges from various global organizations, like Cisco, IBM,
